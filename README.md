# Project Euler Solutions

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/jeremylt/ProjectEuler.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/jeremylt/ProjectEuler)

This code provides solutions to Project Euler problems.

## Building

To build the interactive command line interface:

    make euler

and to run the interface:

    ./euler

## Testing

The test suite produces [TAP](https://testanything.org) output and is run by:

    make test

or, using the `prove` tool distributed with Perl (recommended):

    make prove
